                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 px-3">
                        The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) is a standardized test primarily designed to assess a studentâ€™s college readiness. It serves as a predictor of performance on the SAT, the primary college entrance exam in the United States. The PSAT is composed of two main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math. The EBRW section evaluates a student's ability to comprehend complex texts, analyze information, and express ideas effectively through writing. The Math section assesses problem-solving skills, algebraic thinking, data analysis, and geometric reasoning.

                        Beyond its diagnostic function, the PSAT is crucial for students aspiring to earn scholarships. The National Merit Scholarship Program, for example, uses PSAT scores as a primary criterion for awarding scholarships. A strong performance on the PSAT can provide students with valuable recognition and financial support for their college education. While the PSAT does not carry the same weight as the SAT in college admissions, it offers a valuable opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with the standardized testing format and identify areas for improvement.
