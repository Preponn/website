                        AP Exams are rigorous college-level examinations administered by the College Board. Designed to assess a student's mastery of a specific academic subject, these exams offer high school students the opportunity to earn college credit or advanced placement upon successful completion. AP courses and their corresponding exams cover a wide range of subjects, from mathematics and science to history and English language and composition. By undertaking AP coursework and examinations, students demonstrate their preparedness for higher education and potentially accelerate their academic progression.
