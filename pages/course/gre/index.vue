                        The Graduate Record Examination, or GRE, is an important step in the graduate school or business school application process. The GRE is a multiple-choice, computer-based, standardized exam that is often required for admission to graduate programs and graduate business programs (MBA) globally.

                        The Verbal Section of the GRE is simply a test of vocabulary and reading. So the question
                        always remains, exactly how many words are one required to internalize? Our experts shall only
                        be able to answer this question by reviewing your existing vocabulary. Rest assured, we do not
                        recommend learning a quarter of a million words from the dictionary. We employed the
                        best-practices from the industry to devise a variety of fun tool-based approaches, respecting
                        multiple-intelligences. We ensure that you only learn as many words as you really ever require
                        to score a 160+ in this section. We also help make vocabulary fun.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3">
                        As far as reading goes, we lay emphasis on the transition words, to check direction as you read.
                        This makes it easier to read loosely for the Main Idea, Structure, and Author’s Side, even before
                        answering the questions. Additionally, it is always a good idea to attempt answering the
                        questions by yourself, using information from the passage, without looking at the answer
                        choices. In order to achieve this, we can’t stress enough on practising reading from multiple
                        resources, especially from The Official Guide to the GRE General Test.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3">
                        It is too simplistic to claim that the two scored Verbal sections consist of an equal number (20
                        each) of vocab- and reading-based questions. This is because both the skills are really
                        integrated in all of the questions. To add to the complexity, our research through the recent tests
                        has shown that the GRE is evolving their vocab questions by using apparently less eclectic
                        words, but more convoluted structures; In this case, reading regains focus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3">
                        As a rule of thumb, our approach for reading varies with the length of the passages. While
                        longer passages deal with the entire structure, shorter ones require in-depth reading between
                        sentences. Again, there is nothing subjective about the GRE. We handhold you through the
                        process of effectively working with an Error Log, so you may learn the art of objectively looking
                        for the credited responses, while eliminating incorrect answer choices using trap words, on sight
                        (sometimes, even without reading the questions).
