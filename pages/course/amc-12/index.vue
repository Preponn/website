                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 px-3">
                        The AMC 12 is a highly selective mathematics competition designed to identify exceptional mathematical talent among students in grades 12 and below. As an extension of the AMC 10, it offers a more challenging set of problems that demand a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. The competition consists of 25 multiple-choice questions to be solved within 75 minutes. The problems cover a broader range of mathematical topics than the AMC 10, including precalculus, trigonometry, and introductory calculus concepts. This requires students to possess a strong foundation in algebra, geometry, and number theory, as well as the ability to apply these concepts to novel problem-solving situations.
