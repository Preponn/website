                    <p class="text-justify lh-4 px-3">
                        Pre-calculus is a foundational mathematics course designed to prepare students for the rigorous study of calculus. It serves as a bridge between elementary algebra and trigonometry, consolidating and extending concepts from these areas. This course typically encompasses a comprehensive exploration of functions, including polynomial, rational, radical, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. It delves into the properties, graphs, and transformations of these functions, as well as their applications to real-world problems.
                        <!-- Pre-calculus is a foundational mathematics course that bridges the gap between algebra and calculus. It builds upon algebraic concepts while introducing trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. -->
