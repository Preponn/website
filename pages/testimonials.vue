                       "Mr. Digvijay and Payel's classes greatly helped me with my SAT score. I was able to reach a score in the low 1400s but was not able to break into the 1500s on my own. With Payel and Mr. Digvijay's help, I improved my score by more than 100 points in just a few sessions. Mr. Digvijay helped me to work through my weak points in Math and I scored a perfect 800 in the Math SAT. Payel was able to pinpoint my weaknesses in the SAT reading section and taught me new reading strategies that specifically addressed those areas, greatly boosting my score. Their tutoring was a great help for my SAT."

                        "It is natural to be skeptical about whether a tutor will really help you, especially in subject such as math, which seem to be something solely derived from pure logic. As a senior hoping to take my math score to the next level, this was something that I struggled with, yet through the advice of a few of my friends, I discovered Digvijay Sir / Preponn. Through their simple yet effective style of teaching, they allowed me to grow my skills in the realm of math. The entire structure of the course was personalized for me, and this allowed me to move at a pace perfect for me. Through the classes here, I felt confident enough to retake the SAT and ended up scoring a perfect score in math for the composite total of 1590!"
